\section{Structural complexity}

\begin{parag}{Personal remark}
    Before starting the content, here is a personal advice for this class. The exercise series are really important, there are some definitions in them that are not presented in class (and hence in these notes), although they are supposed to be known at the exam for full points. I for instance have the difference-polynomial complexity class \lang{DP} that comes to my mind, which was defined in our sixth exercise series; and classifying a problem as \lang{DP} would give more points that classifying it as $\lang{P}^{\lang{NP}}$ (this will be defined later in the class, just note that $\lang{DP} \subseteq \lang{P}^{\lang{NP}}$, and hence classifying a problem as \lang{DP} is more fine-grained than $\lang{P}^{\lang{NP}}$).

    Exercise series are always important, but the ones for this class are even more important (and they're quite fun too!), so I'd recommend doing them throughout the semester.

\subsection{Recalls}

\begin{parag}{Remark}
    The first three lectures are completely included in the \textit{Theory of computation} Bachelor class. For completeness, a summary of those lectures will be presented in those notes. For a more complete approach, with more examples, intuition and proofs, one can find my notes for the \textit{Theory of computation} class at:

\subsubsection{\lang{P} complexity class}

\begin{parag}{Church-Turing thesis}
    A Turing machine can be converted to any usual programming language; and any program can be converted to a Turing machine.

    \begin{subparag}{Implication}
        Therefore, we will not work explicitly work with Turing machines, but simply with algorithms.
    \end{subparag}
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: Running time}
    Let $M$ be a Turing machine that halts on all inputs.

    We define its \important{running time}, or \important{time complexity}, as the function $t_M: \mathbb{N} \mapsto \mathbb{N}$, so that: 
    \[t_M\left(n\right) = \max_{w \in \left\{0, 1\right\}^n} \left\{\text{number of steps for $M\left(w\right)$ to halt}\right\}.\]
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: Kleene star}
    Let $\Sigma$ be a set.

    The \important{Kleene star} of $\Sigma$, written $\Sigma^*$, is defined all concatenations of elements of $\Sigma$. 

    \begin{subparag}{Example}
        For instance: 
        \[\left\{0, 1\right\}^* = \left\{\epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, \ldots\right\},\]
        where $\epsilon$ is the empty string.
    \end{subparag}
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: Language}
    Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet, and let $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ be arbitrary.

    $L$ is said to be a \important{language}. Moreover, any $x \in L$ is said to belong to the language.

    \begin{subparag}{Remark 1}
        Typically, $\Sigma = \left\{0, 1\right\}$.
    \end{subparag}

    \begin{subparag}{Remark 2}
        It is possible to see languages equivalently as a function $L: \left\{0, 1\right\}^* \mapsto \left\{0, 1\right\}$, where an element $x$ belongs to the language if and only if $L\left(x\right) = 1$.
    \end{subparag}
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: Encoding}
    Let $T$ be an arbitrary object and $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. 

    We note $\left\langle T \right\rangle \in \Sigma^*$ to be the smallest encoding of $T$ in our alphabet.

    \begin{subparag}{Remark}
        We will only work with $\Sigma = \left\{0, 1\right\}$, in which case $\left\langle T \right\rangle$ is just a binary encoding of $T$. For instance, if $T = \left(V, E\right)$ is a graph, $\left\langle T \right\rangle$ would be a way to represent $T$ in the memory of a computer.

        The importance of the term ``smallest'' in the definition appears when we handle numbers: $\left\langle n \right\rangle$ has size $\left\lceil \log_2\left(n\right) \right\rceil $. It is sometimes necessary to consider a unary basis, in which case we write $\left\langle 1^n \right\rangle$, which is a $1$ repeated $n$ times and thus has size $n$.
    \end{subparag}
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: Decider}
    Let $L$ be a language, and $M$ be a Turing machine.

    $M$ is said to be a \important{decider} for $L$ if: 
    \[x \in L \iff M\left(x\right) = 1.\]

    It is moreover said to be \important{polynomial time} if its running time on $\left\langle x \right\rangle$ is polynomial in $\left|x\right|$. 
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: \lang{TIME}}
    Let $t: \mathbb{N} \mapsto \mathbb{N}$ be some function. 

    The \important{$\lang{TIME}\left(t\left(n\right)\right)$} complexity class is defined by: 
    \[\lang{TIME}\left(t\left(n\right)\right) = \left\{L \subseteq \Sigma^* \suchthat \text{There exists some TM deciding $L$ in time $O\left(t\left(n\right)\right)$}\right\}.\]
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: \lang{P}}
    The complexity class \important{\lang{P}} (polynomial) is defined as the class of languages that have a poly-time decider:
    \[\lang{P} = \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} \lang{TIME}\left(n^k\right).\]
\end{parag}

\subsubsection{\lang{NP} complexity class}

\begin{parag}{Definition: Verifier}
    Let $L$ be a language, and $V$ be a Turing machine.

    $V$ is said to be a \important{verifier} for $L$ if, for all $x \in \Sigma^*$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $x \in L$, there exists some $c \in \Sigma^*$ so that $V\left(x, c\right) = 1$.
        \item If $x \not \in L$, then for all $c \in \Sigma^*$, $V\left(x, c\right) = 0$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    This $c$ is said to be a \important{certificate} or \important{witness}.

    $V$ is moreover said to be \important{polynomial time} if its running time on $\left\langle x, c \right\rangle$ is polynomial in $\left|x\right|$.

    \begin{subparag}{Remark}
        If $V$ is a poly-time verifier for $L$, then, for any $x \in L$, there exists some $c \in \Sigma^*$ so that $M\left(x, c\right) = 1$ \textit{and} $\left|c\right|$ is polynomial in $\left|x\right|$. Indeed, otherwise, just the time to read $\left|c\right|$ would make the verifier exceed its computation time.
    \end{subparag}
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: NTM}
    Informally, a \important{non-deterministic Turing machine} (NTM) is a Turing machine with the twist that, at any step, it can transition to any number of states (not just one).

    \begin{subparag}{Remark}
        As mentioned earlier, for a more formal definition, one can consider my \textit{Theory of computation} notes.
    \end{subparag}
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: Non-deterministic decider}
    Let $L$ be a language, and $M$ be a non-deterministic Turing machine.

    $M$ is said to be a \important{non-deterministic decider} for $L$ if: 
    \[x \in L \iff M\left(x\right) = 1.\]

    More precisely, for all $x \in \Sigma^*$: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $x \in L$, some computation path of $M$ on $x$ accepts.
        \item If $x \not \in L$, all computations path of $M$ on $x$ reject.
    \end{itemize}

    It is moreover said to be \important{polynomial time} if, for all $x$, the running time of its longest computation path is polynomial in $\left|x\right|$.
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Theorem: NTM and verifier equivalence}
    Let $L$ be a language.

    $L$ has a non-deterministic poly-time decider if and only $L$ has a poly-time verifier.
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: \lang{NTIME}}
    Let $t: \mathbb{N} \mapsto \mathbb{N}$ be some function.

    The \important{$\lang{NTIME}\left(t\left(n\right)\right)$} complexity class is defined by: 
    \autoeq{\lang{NTIME}\left(t\left(n\right)\right) = \left\{L \subseteq \Sigma^* \suchthat \text{There exists some NTM deciding $L$ in time $O\left(t\left(n\right)\right)$}\right\} = \left\{L \subseteq \Sigma^* \suchthat \text{There exists some verifier for $L$ running in time $O\left(t\left(n\right)\right)$}\right\}.}
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Definition: \lang{NP} class}
    The complexity class \important{\lang{NP}} (non-deterministic polynomial) is defined as the class of languages that have poly-time non-deterministic deciders, i.e. languages that have poly-time verifiers: 
    \[\lang{NP} = \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} \lang{NTIME}\left(n^k\right).\]

    \begin{subparag}{Remark}
        It is easy to notice that $\lang{P} \subseteq \lang{NP}$. Indeed, any problem that has a poly-time decider also has a poly-time verifier: the verifier can simply ignore the certificate and run the decider on $x$. Whether $\lang{NP} \subseteq \lang{P}$ (and thus $\lang{P} = \lang{NP}$) is however an open (and very famous) question.

        We will try to argue with the following lectures why, intuitively, we should have $\lang{P} \neq \lang{NP}$.
