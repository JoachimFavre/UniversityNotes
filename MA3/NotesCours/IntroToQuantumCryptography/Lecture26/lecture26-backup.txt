    We have seen different types of cryptographic results. Some were new (i.e.~impossible with classical), others were information-theoretic secure (whereas classical requires computational assumption) and some that just improved classical results.

    New:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quantum one-time pad.
        \item Quantum money
        \item Encryption with certified deletion.
        \item Delegated computation
    \end{itemize}

    Information-theoretic security:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quantum-key distribution; and evarlasting security is in newcategory.
        \item Coin flipping (it is impossible to get any security without computational assumption classically; but quantum allows to alleviate this a bit)
        \item BC implies OT
    \end{itemize}
    

    Improved:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Secret sharing
    \end{itemize}

    We also introduced the following ideas and techniques:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Density matrices
        \item Pauli matrices
        \item Security games \later{Security is donewith respect to some security game, which is very limited. The bomb-testing is a good example}
        \item Quantum channels
        \item Approximate cloning and quantitative no-cloning.
        \item SDPs and duality.
        \item (Quantum) conditional min-entropy
        \item 2-universal functions and privacy amplification (and PGMs)
        \item Guessing games
        \item Information reconciliation using error correction codes
        \item Entanglement and CHSH games
        \item Security games and the simulation paradigm
        \item Computational assumptions such as pseudo-random functions (PRF); which we used to construct BC, authentified channel, short-key encryption.
        \item Clifford gates and magic states
    \end{itemize}
    

    We also found the following facts: \later{remove}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Key-length qOTP is twice the key-length of classical OTP.
    \end{itemize}

    What we did not cover:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Foundational assumptions such as pseudo-random states (PRStates).
        \item Quantum cryptography with computational assumptions (all the things that we can get without assumptions were essentially done in the class), such as quantum-fully homomorphic encryption (QFHE), \ldots
        \item Complexity and interactive proofs (class from Chiesa).
        \item Post-quantum cryptography (class from Vanderey).
    \end{itemize}
